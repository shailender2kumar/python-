print('''will not reserve order. Everyone knows it is a high-profile matter. I will pass the order after hearing it. I will not reserve the order," Judge Bindu said.

The Court today heard the arguments made by Kejriwal's counsel. Enforcement Directorate (ED) also made arguments at length but could not complete them today.

"I have to pass some orders (in other cases) and give dasti copies," the judge said as she deferred the hearing to Thursday.

Kejriwal, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in March this year on money laundering charges in the Delhi excise policy case, has moved for regular bail for the first time.

His application to allow his wife Sunita Kejriwal to remain present during his examination by medical board was also heard today. The Court had earlier called for a report from the Tihar Jail in this regard.

It had made it clear that it was seeking a response from the Tihar Jail and not the ED as Kejriwal is in judicial custody and the central agency has no role to play when it comes to him seeking relief like treatment inside jail.
